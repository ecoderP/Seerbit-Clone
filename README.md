# Seerbit-Clone
This task involves the cloning of a seebit website page in the shortest time possible.

The project took me 2 hours to complete - cloning some major elements of the web page and adding a media query to add some responsiveness.

Tech: HTML and CSS

Here's how the original web page looked on desktop and mobile:
